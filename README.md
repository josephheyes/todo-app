# Planito - a To-Do List app

This app is an attempt to learn Flutter (and app dev in general). The code is bad, naturally. The name is the best I could come up with (it means 'little plan' in Spanish).

## Current Features

- Adding events to a list that are saved in a local database
- Specifying category of events
- Editing events

## Planned Features

- Adding new categories
- Saving separate lists

## Demo

Here is a short demo of the app running. There are currently a few issues, such as having to manually refresh when an event is created.
