# Dristle (Placeholder name) - a To-Do List app

This app is an attempt to learn Flutter (and app dev in general). The code is bad, naturally.

## Current Features

- Adding events to a list that are saved in a local database
- Specifying category of events
- Editing events

## Current Planned Features

- Adding new categories
- Saving separate lists



Special thanks to Nathan Burgess for the name (and debugging).
